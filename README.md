# Valorant Night Market 

This is a **Valorant Night Market Simulator** project, allowing players to simulate the experience of buying skins from the Valorant Night Market. The simulator is designed using **Python** with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using **Tkinter**.

## Features

- **Random Skin Offers**: Each time the Night Market is opened, a selection of random skins is displayed with varying rarities and prices.
- **Skin Purchasing**: Players can purchase skins from the market if they have enough balance. The balance decreases with each purchase.
- **Inventory System**: Players' purchased skins are added to their inventory, allowing them to track their collection.
- **Player Stats**: Track total spent, number of purchases, and calculate a player score based on purchases and spending.
- **Discounted Prices**: Each skin offers a discounted price, making it possible for players to purchase skins at a reduced cost.
- **Timer System**: A timer counts down the time remaining for purchasing skins in the market.
- **Data Logging**: Game data, including transactions, is saved in a CSV file for future analysis.
