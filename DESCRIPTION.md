## Game Mechanics & Functionality

* Players start with a set balance and have limited time to make purchasing decisions.
* Each session features six randomized skins with discounts ranging from 10% to 50%.
* Scoring is based on spending efficiency, number of skins purchased, and the total value of acquisitions.
* Once time expires, the game summary and final score are displayed.

## Project Review

The classic *Tetris* game focuses on spatial arrangement, increasing difficulty, and score tracking. The *Valorant Night Market Simulator* introduces a new twist by combining time-limited purchasing with resource management.

* Both games involve quick decision-making and strategy.
* This game incorporates randomized discounts and skins, ensuring each playthrough is unique.
* Data tracking and visualization add layers of depth, enabling performance analysis over multiple sessions.

## Programming Development

### 3.1 Game Concept

The *Valorant Night Market Challenge* is a high-paced purchasing game with a strategic focus. Players aim to maximize purchases and scoring efficiency within a limited time frame.

**Key Features:**

* **Timer-Based Gameplay:** Players must act quickly before the timer runs out.
* **Randomized Discounts:** Each session presents different skins and deals.
* **Scoring System:** Points are awarded for strategic purchases and spending efficiency.
* **Game Summary Screen:** Displays final score and key metrics at the end of each session.

**Bonus Features:**

* Leaderboard for high scores.
* Combo system: Bonus points for rapid consecutive purchases.

### 3.2 Object-Oriented Programming Implementation

1. **Player:** Manages player balance, inventory, and scoring.

   * Attributes: `balance`, `inventory`, `total_spent`
   * Methods: `purchase_skin()`, `add_money()`, `calculate_score()`

2. **Market:** Generates and manages skin offers and discounts.

   * Attributes: `available_skins`, `discounts`
   * Methods: `generate_offers()`, `apply_discount()`

3. **Skin:** Represents a skin with pricing and rarity.

   * Attributes: `name`, `base_price`, `discounted_price`, `rarity`
   * Methods: `calculate_discount_price()`

4. **GameManager:** Manages game flow, timer, and end-game logic.

   * Attributes: `time_left`, `player`, `market`
   * Methods: `start_game()`, `update_timer()`, `end_game()`

5. **StatsManager:** Collects and analyzes game data.

   * Attributes: `purchase_history`, `highest_score`
   * Methods: `save_data()`, `load_data()`, `analyze_stats()`

### 3.3 Algorithms Involved

* **Randomization Algorithm:** Generates six random skins with varying discounts each session.
* **Countdown Timer:** Implements time-based game logic.
* **Scoring Algorithm:** Calculates player score based on purchases, remaining balance, and spending efficiency.

## Statistical Data (Prop Stats)

### 4.1 Data Features

* **Total Money Spent:** Analyzes spending behavior and strategy.
* **Number of Skins Purchased:** Tracks the number of acquisitions per session.
* **Highest Value Skin:** Identifies the most valuable skin bought in a session.
* **Purchase Speed:** Measures time taken between purchases to assess player decision-making speed.
* **Game Duration:** Tracks how long the player remains active in each session.

### 4.2 Data Recording Method

Data will be stored in a CSV file (`purchase.csv`) and (`leaderboard.csv`).

* Each row represents a game session, recording key metrics such as total money spent, skins purchased, and final score.

### 4.3 Data Analysis & Visualization

Data will be analyzed using basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) and visualized through:

* Bar Graphs: Compare average VP spent per session.
